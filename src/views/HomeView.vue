    <h3>What is TypeScript?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language.
      <br>
      While JavaScript is dynamically typed, TypeScript allows developers to define types explicitly, reducing runtime errors and improving code quality.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>In the context of Vue 3, TypeScript shines by providing robust type checking and better tooling support, making development safer and more maintainable.</p>
